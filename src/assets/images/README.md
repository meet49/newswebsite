# Image Assets

This directory contains image assets for the ReadNShare news website.

## Structure

Organize your images by category:

```
images/
├── logos/
│   └── readnshare-logo.png
├── articles/
│   ├── world-news/
│   ├── technology/
│   ├── economy/
│   └── explained/
└── ui/
    └── icons/
```

## Guidelines

- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `climate-summit-2026.jpg`)
- Optimize images before adding them
- Keep file sizes reasonable (< 500KB for article images)
- Use WebP format when possible for better compression
- Maintain consistent aspect ratios (16:9 or 4:3)

## Copyright

All images must have proper licensing. For stock photos, use:
- Unsplash (free, no attribution required)
- Pexels (free, no attribution required)
- Your own photography
- Licensed stock photos

Always verify usage rights before publishing.
